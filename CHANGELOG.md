# Changelog

Every skill folder carries its own version in the `metadata.version` field of its
`SKILL.md`. This file records what changed in each release, so a skill copied earlier
can be compared against the current one.

## 1.1.0, 2026-09-17

**Where a skill stops changed.** Every skill used to stop once before the work, on a plan
it had already written. That stop is gone. Five skills now stop earlier instead, on what
they understood the request to be, before anything is planned or read:
`research-proposal-drafter`, `research-document-reviewer`, `research-feedback-reviser`,
`research-analysis-coder`, `research-defense-questions`. The other five have no stop before
the work at all, and each says why in one line: their work runs against something fixed
that already exists, so there is nothing about the job to misread.
`research-document-auditor`, `research-english-editor`, `research-paper-finder`,
`research-section-drafter`, `research-text-humanizer`. The stop at the end is unchanged in
all ten. Skills that asked for an input before starting still ask for it; that ask is not
a gate.

**research-proposal-drafter**: the three-round revision loop is gone, with its four stops.
The skill now takes one round of intake, then writes the draft, the references, and the
three ranked comments without stopping, audits, and hands everything over at once for you
to decide. Predictions got a standard: two or three, each stated so a result could
contradict it, each tied to something the design actually measures. Positioning references
got a pointer, three to six, stated as a recommendation the skill judges rather than a rule.

**research-feedback-reviser**: the mid-work stop is gone. The skill now drafts the smallest
change that meets each item itself, names a genuinely different alternative in one line
where one exists, and you decide once at the end with the drafts in front of you instead of
twice. Unclear items become a question for your supervisor; items waiting on data you do not
have become a task. Choosing how to meet a comment is the skill's job; judging whether the
comment is right stays yours.

**research-document-reviewer**: the minor-comment cap is now twenty rather than ten, as a
ceiling and not a target; over the cap the skill ranks by cost to the document and lists
what fell. A location is now strongly recommended rather than required: page numbers pulled
out of a PDF are unreliable, so where one cannot be confirmed the skill names the section,
table, or figure instead and says so.

**research-document-auditor**: a reference list pasted on its own now runs the reference
check alone, with no intake and no memo, and says what did not run.

**research-defense-questions**: a question your thesis cannot answer is no longer dropped.
It moves to a closing section of its own, outside the numbered list your answers are graded
against, because in a defense that is the question you most need to see coming.

**research-paper-finder**: asks for your supervisor's or department's journal list first,
and offers the FT50 as a named public starting point where you have none, saying what it is
and that it is one list among several. Added a check against the obvious miss: describe two
or three things the literature almost certainly contains and search for the descriptions,
never for a remembered title. The auditor's coverage note is now acted on rather than only
printed. `research-paper-auditor.md` moved to `research-paper-finder/references/`.

**research-text-humanizer**: added a clean exit, so a passage with no structural tell and no
chat leftover is reported as fine rather than mined for vocabulary flags. Added one tell,
mechanically alternating sentence lengths. Noted that "robust", "key" and "significant" are
ordinary words here and are not flagged alone.

**research-english-editor**: the skill now builds the do-not-touch list from your document
(construct names, condition labels, hypothesis labels, variable names, defined
abbreviations) plus whatever you named, shows it before editing, and counts against it at
the end.

## 1.0.1, 2026-09-08

- **research-english-editor**: `compatibility` added to the frontmatter. The skill needs a host
  that can write Word tracked changes into a .docx, and said so only in its body text, where a
  host program reading the frontmatter could not see it.
- **README**: the plain-text route no longer tells you to open a second chat and paste the work
  in. Every skill already handles a missing helper itself, by running the same check in a fresh
  pass and saying that is what it did. The README now says that, so the README and the ten
  skills give one answer instead of two.

## 1.0.0, 2026-09-08

First versioned release. All ten skills and the bundled `research-paper-auditor`.

Changed in this release:

- **research-document-reviewer**: the defender pass moved out of the helper and into the
  skill itself, as a deliberately separate pass, with four refutation questions and a kill
  log shown at Gate 2. Deciding whether a comment survives is a judgment, and a helper
  that kills a real concern removes the comment the author most needed.
- **research-document-auditor**: the second reader now answers four numbered questions and
  compares each severity against the three definitions the skill states, instead of judging
  whether a severity is fair. Adjusting a severity is the skill's call, reported at Gate 2.
- **research-proposal-drafter**: the audit split into two passes. A helper checks that the
  references resolve, that their form is right, that citations and list entries match, and
  that the checkable facts hold. Claim support, academic English, and AI slop moved to a
  separate pass by the skill, because judging how a draft reads is not a lookup. The helper
  no longer proposes replacement wording outside a corrected reference entry.
- **research-defense-questions**: the second reader reports an ungrounded question and
  changes nothing. The skill does the dropping and reports every drop at Gate 2.
- **Nine skills**: the second stop is now marked with CHECKPOINT, so both promised stops
  are labelled. research-english-editor is unchanged here: it designs one stop and says so.
- **Every skill**: `license` and `metadata.version` added to the frontmatter.
- **Repository**: LICENSE file added (CC BY 4.0).
